                Hey, I am Aryan Babber. I am a Front end Developer who is also in 2<sup>nd</sup> year of BCA. I code in HTML, CSS and JS along with the libraries that come along with it like React & Tailwind, both of which are used to build this. I believe in Googling the problems and finding the answers on Google itself since its an ocean of solutions. Another Reason is the fact that Googling a problem is a skill on its own since one must know what to search for. And as for Programming, it all started on June 2021 right after my school was over.
                </p>
                <div className="mt-4">My hobbies are:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li className="ml-6 before:content-['ðŸ‘‰']"> Going out for a walk</li>
                    <li className="ml-6 before:content-['ðŸ‘‰']"> Coding</li>
                    <li className="ml-6 before:content-['ðŸ‘‰']"> Gym</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-6">
                    This is just a start and I believe that this journey will only go up and beyond. I also contribute towards open source projects often.
                </p>
